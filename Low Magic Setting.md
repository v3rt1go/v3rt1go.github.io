## Low Magic Settings

Magic exists in a Low Magic setting, but it remains subtle, elusive, and sometimes dark and dangerous.

### The Mundane

So what do adventurers do in a Low Magic setting? What humans have done in every world and in every time: earn gold by unsavory means, fight wars, rescue maidens[1](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/low-magic-5e/#fn:1) (usually for a price), eat, drink, and kill each other over trifles. A Low Magic world is like any other adventuring world, only without the conveniences and safety of magic on command.

### The Monstrous

If magic is subtle, monsters aren’t. Monsters may be beasts of unusual size and ferocity, ordinary animals warped by magic (or demons or witches), primeval beasts heretofore unknown, or people cursed long ago into bestial form. This last theory explains monsters of humanoid shape and manlike intelligence such as undead and goblins, as well as certain dragons said to be able to talk.

### The Arcane

For nearly all of humanity (and other sapient species) magic is a matter of legends and myths. Fae haunt the woods, but few have seen a fae (and lived). Priests pray to idols of stone and bronze, but the gods they pray to may or may not hear them. Every place has a story about some monster who threatened the town; some may even be true.

Magic takes many forms. These are the most common.

#### Curses and Fate

Words spoken in anger or hate, especially by a dying man, can echo across the years to doom the target of that curse. All mortals are born under good stars or ill, and the fate the stars fortell cannot be eluded, only subverted.

#### Charms and Incantations

Nearly everyone uses charms or rhymes to ward off misfortune or invite good luck. Most of these do not work, save to calm the nerves of those chanting them. Yet words have power, as curses demonstrate. Some words, in the right order and addressed to the right entities, can pierce the veils between worlds and summon forces and beings which can only be called Magic. _Finding_ these incantations can take the work of a lifetime, and sometimes the effect is _not_ what the magician intended.[2](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/low-magic-5e/#fn:2)

#### The Otherworlds

Just as all but the most ignorant knows the world is a sphere, all learned people in a low magic world know there are other worlds: the world of the dead, the world of nature spirits, the poisoned paradise called Faerie, the many hells from which demons come, and so forth. They may argue how many such worlds exist, and how they’re related, but nobody doubts their existence.

#### Witchcraft

A tiny minority of humans(?) can channel magical forces at will. Opinions differ on exactly what these “witches” are. Evil women who made pacts with demons for supernatural power? Remnants of an ancient order of enchantresses? Diminished demigoddesses from the dawn of time? A particular lineage or strain of “mutant” touched by magic? About all the “authorities” can agree upon is that Witches are dangerous and should be avoided.

## Creating a Low Magic Character

Creating a character for a low-magic setting is almost the same as creating any other D&D 5e character:

1. Choose an [Ancestry](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/low-magic-5e/#ancestries) appropriate to the setting.
2. Choose a [Culture](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/low-magic-5e/#cultures) appropriate to the setting.
3. Generate or assign [Ability Scores](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/low-magic-5e/#ability-scores).
4. Choose a [Background](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/low-magic-5e/#backgrounds) from the ones listed below.
5. Choose a [Class](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/low-magic-5e/#classes) from the ones listed below.
6. Record all the abilities, proficiencies, [languages](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/low-magic-5e/#languages), and equipment provided by Ancestry, Culture, Background, and Class.
    - Characters may not start with magic items, but they _may_ purchase [masterwork items](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#masterwork-items) if they can afford them.
    - Non-enchanted mithral or adamantine items are not considered ehcnanted, but they are uncommon or rare and therefore only available through adventuring.

### Ancestries

In the absence of setting-specific Ancestries, the default is Human:

- Your Size is Medium
- Your base walking speed is 30'.

[Non-human Ancestries](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/low-magic-species-5e/) _may_ be available, including [Dwarf](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/low-magic-dwarfs-5e/) and [Eldren](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/low-magic-eldren-5e/) . Check with your DM.

### Cultures

Your DM will present you with Cultures appropriate to your setting. [Generic Cultures](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/low-magic-cultures-5e/) _may_ be available. Check with your DM.

In the absence of setting-specific Cultures, give the character any two skill, tool, or vehicle proficiencies of their choice.

### Ability Scores

First, generate or assign Ability Scores using one of the methods in the _Players’ Handbook_.

Then, add points to the Ability Scores as follows:

- Characters of Human Ancestry add 1 to _all_ Ability Scores, as described in the _Players’ Handbook_.
    
- Characters of other Ancestries add three points to at least two Ability Scores.
    

### Backgrounds

These are the available backgrounds in a Low Magic campaign. Specific settings may restrict or add backgrounds.

Player Characters can speak Common and their Cultural tongue plus one other language if their INT is at least 12.

They may also gain languages from their Background or Class.

Consult the DM, who will have a list of all available languages.

## Combat and Adventuring

Even without magic the rules of D&D 5th Edition still apply, except when superseded by my [house rules](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/).

Most of these house rules enhance the “gritty” feel of a Low Magic campaign, but certain rules give players an edge:

- [Initiative](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#initiative) both streamlines Initiative and lets players go first, albeit not with all their normal actions.
    
- [Luck Points](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#luck-points) somewhat make up for the loss of magic by enabling extraordinary actions a few times during a session.
    
- [Masterwork Items](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#masterwork-items) replace the common and frankly boring “+1 magic swords” with +1 mundane swords.
    
- [Silvered Weapons](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#silvered-weapons) covers the main weapons against undead and other monsters in a world without easy magic.

1. Maidenhood not guaranteed. [↩︎](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/low-magic-5e/#fnref:1)
    
2. At the moment Incantations are a story element, not a formal magic system. Our protagonists must stop an evil cultist from sacrificing a noble’s daughter and summoning a foul demon. An Arcanist translates an old book and unwittingly unleashes a malevolent spirit. A hedge magician knows the precautions and rituals to keep the fae at bay … but they don’t always work. And so on.
    
    A full Ritual Magic system will be available … someday. Until then, enjoy these [fragments](https://frank-mitchell.com/tags/ritual-magic/). [↩︎](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/low-magic-5e/#fnref:2)

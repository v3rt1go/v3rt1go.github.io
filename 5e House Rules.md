ADDED 2024-07-24: [Multiclassing](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#multiclassing)

This page details house rules for any D&D 5e game I run, excluding those using the [Nimble](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/nimble-rules/) modifications to D&D 5e. They are a work in progress.

Other rules _may_ be in effect, for example those for [Gridless Combat](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/gridless/).

## Action Points

(Most of this comes from [Nimble](https://nimble5e.com/).)

Instead of Actions, Move Actions, Bonus Actions, and Reactions, players track only _Action Points_. (NPCs and monsters continue to use the old system.)

Starting after the [first round of combat](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#initiative), every player character has three Action Points to spend between the end of one turn and the next. Each player’s Action Points refresh at the _end_ of their turn.

Except as noted below, anything that can be accomplished in an Action, Move Action, Bonus Action, or Reaction takes exactly **one Action Point** to perform. When a player runs out of Action Points, they may take no other actions or reactions until the end of their turn.

### Action Points and Magic

Cantrips, leveled spells, and spell-like powers that require only a reaction or Bonus Action take **1 AP** to cast.

Leveled spells that normally require an action to cast take _at least_ **2 AP**.

Fireball and spells equal to or higher than 6th level take **3 AP**.

## Alignments

My games will use one of two schemes for Alignment:

1. Alignment doesn’t matter. Players may _declare_ any alignment for their characters that they wish, but it does not affect the rules or world in any respect.
    
2. Alignment reflects one’s part in a cosmic struggle. See [“D&D Hard Mode Alignment”](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd-hard-alignment/) for details.
    

The DM will let you know which scheme is in effect before play.

## Darkvision

The D&D SRD describes Darkvision thus:

> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Dim light imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks involving sight.

Instead of three categories of light – bright light, dim light, and darkness – I’ll use bright light, dim light, _near darkness_ and _total darkness_.

**Near Darkness** creates a _heavily obscured_ area to creatures without Darkvision, i.e. they are totally Blinded. Characters may encounter near darkness outdoors on a cloudy moonless night or indoors with minimal light sources like a candle or indirect outside light.

**Total Darkness** creates a _heavily obscured_ area even to creatures with Darkvision, i.e. they are totally Blinded. Characters face total darkness deep underground[1](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#fn:1) when no light source, even a candle, is present.

|Category|Normal vision|Darkvision|
|---|---|---|
|Bright Light|Normal|Normal|
|Dim Light|Disadvantage|Normal|
|Near Dark|Blinded|Disadvantage|
|Total Dark|Blinded|Blinded|

In other words, even beings with Darkvision require at least a _little_ light to see. Only those with Blindsight can see in the total absence of light by utilizing other senses: echolocation, vibration, heat, etc. One can blind or confuse such creatures _if_ one knows what their primary sense is.

## Dice

Both players and DM should roll dice publicly, where everyone can see them.

The DM may bend this rule in two instances:

1. The DM may keep rolls on a random table secret until the appropriate moment.
    
2. The DM (and players!) may make “decision rolls” which function like a coin toss but with more sides to decide among several alternatives. A d6 or d100 is a typical decision die.
    

## Feats

Assume you may not take **any** Feat unless the DM says otherwise.

Generally I don’t play with Feats. If players want to try some action that’s only “allowed” with a feat (or class or race ability), they may try it, but I may request an ability check and set a high DC if it sounds fiendishly difficult.

I believe players do not need permission from feats, class abilities, etc. to try anything a normal or heroic human(oid) could do. Rather, they’re [affordances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance) that suggest or enable extraordinary actions.

As a corollary to the lack of Feats, the Variant human race is not allowed. The standard human race is, on the other hand, encouraged.

Concrete alternatives to feats include:

- [**Luck Points:**](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#luck-points) Often you can achieve what you want by spending a Luck Point on it. Or maybe two or three.
    
- **Natural 20:** If you roll a natural 20, instead of rolling extra damage I’ll let you choose a special effect, e.g. the target is knocked down or knocked back.
    
- **Spending an extra action:** For example, if you spend one of your Actions aiming at a target, I’ll let you make the next ranged attack with Advantage.
    
- **The Rule of Cool:** just try something and roll the dice!
    

## Initiative

Rather than using the Initiative Rules As Written, I will use the following procedure.

(Most of this comes from [Nimble](https://nimble5e.com/).)

### Start of Combat

At the beginning of combat, the players roll a _**Wisdom**_ check. The result of the roll determines the actions the players’ character may take for the _first round only_:

|Result|Actions|
|---|---|
|≤ 9|1 [Action Point](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#action-points)|
|10 - 19|2 [Action Points](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#action-points)|
|≥ 20|3 [Action Points](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#action-points)|

Any actions that initiate combat are counted against a player’s Action Point budget.

If the PCs surprise the NPCs, they make their rolls with Advantage. If the NPCs surprise the PCs, they make their rolls with Disadvantage.

### Start of Round

At the beginning of _each_ round, players announce their action for their turn, in any order. The DM also announces actions for all NPCs. Anyone who does not announce an action _three minutes_ after the round starts loses their turn. (They may still take Reactions.)

### Players’ Turns

Players act clockwise from the DM’s left[2](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#fn:2), resolving the action they announced at the top of the round. If their action becomes impossible or redundant (e.g. striking a dead foe), they have _three seconds_ to choose another action or lose their turn.

### DM’s Turn

When all players have acted, the DM resolves actions for their NPCs. Then the Round ends.

## Languages

“Common” is merely the most widely spoken among human(?) languages. In some cases characters learn _two_ “Common” languages, an ethnic Common reflecting the people who live in the area and a political Common reflecting the dominant culture or political entity. Settings may in fact introduce multiple languages among humanity and [other races](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#races). Read the setting material closely for details.

Player characters know the common spoken and written forms of all the languages listed on their character sheet.

In rare instances the DM may handle languages completely differently, e.g. through [language checks](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/language-check/)or by categorizing [written languages](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/language-scripts/#hybrid-approach). The setting material and DM will inform you of this before play.

## Long Rests

See [Rests](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#rests).

## Luck Points

See [Luck Points](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/luck-points/) for more detail.

Under D20-based rules, spending a Luck Point has _one_ of the following effects:

1. If spent before a d20 is rolled, the roll has Advantage.
2. If spent after a d20 is rolled, the player may add +3 to the total _or_ reroll the die. If they reroll, they must keep the new number unless they spend another Luck Point.
3. If spent before or after damage is rolled, the player may add 1d6 to the damage total.
4. The player may add a detail to the scene, e.g. a ladder in the corner.
5. The player may trigger a [Complication](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/luck-points/#complications) on an NPC or place.

The DM will let you know the specific number of Luck Points at the start of each session and whether the optional rules for [Complications](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/luck-points/#complications), [Great Luck Points](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/luck-points/#great-luck-points), and/or [Bad Luck Points](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/luck-points/#bad-luck-points) are in effect.

## Masterwork Items

Master artisans can produce “masterwork items” that aren’t magical but grant bonuses on attack rolls or skill rolls. If no other rules are in effect, use these:

1. A “masterwork weapon” adds +1 or +2 to attack rolls and damage rolls. It is non-magical, and has no other effects.
    
2. A masterwork tool or set of masterwork tools add +1 or +2 to a skill roll using the tool(s). It is non-magical, and has no other effects.
    
3. Armor and shields _may_ be masterwork, but that does not increase their AC, lower the minimum Strength required to wear them, or decrease the penalties to Stealth. Only magic or exotic materials like mithral, adamantine, orichalcum, celestium, or tenebrium provide those properties. (See [“Fantasy Metals”](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/metals/) for more.)
    
4. Masterwork items have Advantage, or impose Disadvantage, on any attack against the item intended to shatter it. Once shattered, however, the item must be reforged from scratch by a master artisan to be considered masterwork once again.
    
5. A masterwork item usually costs half again its base price for a +1 bonus (or less), or twice its base price for +2.
    

## Money

Unless stated otherwise, all my worlds are on a silver standard, with gold being much more rare than in the standard D&D setting. See [“The Ecstasy of Gold: Money in RPGs”](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/money-in-rpgs/) for more more information, including [tables of prices in silver](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/money-in-rpgs/#appendix-a-5e-srd-prices-in-silver). (Hint: simply multiply prices in gp by 10.)

To prevent PCs from carrying around literal pounds of sterling silver, the Merchants’ Guild[3](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#fn:3) offers “bank notes” accepted by merchants in the same town. Simply deposit a quantity of silver (or gold!) with them in exchange for a bank note (bespoke or standard denominations), give those notes to the merchants, and let the merchants settle with the Guild. Obviously this does not help if the PCs are traveling[4](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#fn:4) or end up in a small village or hamlet, but at least it makes shopping trips easier.

## Multiclassing

**Multiclassing is an optional rule.** I personally do not want to exercise that option, so I will only allow multiclassing for _roleplaying_ reasons, e.g. the character converted to a specific religion, so they’re becoming a Paladin or CLeric now.

As a DM I’m just a little tired of people who multiclass two or even three times just to get a nifty ability from a particular class, e.g. Fighters and their attacks or Rogues and their Expertise. If you start as a Rogue, _stay_ as a Rogue, don’t take one level and say, “meh, not for me” and become a Warlock.[5](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#fn:5)

Thus endeth the rant.

## “Races”

As presented in [Ancestries and Cultures](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/314622/Ancestry--Culture-An-Alternative-to-Race-in-5e), each “race” is divided into an “Ancestry” – their genetic(?) heritage – and a “Culture” – the people among whom they were raised. In my worlds this will be handled in three ways:

1. _Standard Ancestries and Cultures:_ Players may choose any Ancestry and Culture presented in [the supplement](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/314622/Ancestry--Culture-An-Alternative-to-Race-in-5e). Note that, for example, a Dwarf raised by Dwarves is simply a Dwarf as presented in the _Player’s Handbook_ or SRD.
    
2. _Custom Ancestries and Cultures:_ The campaign writeup will list or specify all ancestries and cultures available in the setting.
    
3. _Humans Only:_ All players may only choose Human as their ancestry, as presented in the _Player’s Handbook_. Players may only take the Variant Human option if the DM allows [Feats](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#feats).
    

The DM will inform you which option is in effect before play.

## Rests

These rules define _three_ types of Rests.

1. **Short Rests** require an hour of relaxation or light activity and provide the same benefits as in the Rules As Written.
    
2. **Long Short Rests** require sleep (or equivalent) for at least six hours, which must be taken in a warm place while in the wilderness or in a dungeon. Player characters receive the benefits of a _Short Rest_, but may roll spent Hit Dice with Advantage (i.e. roll two, keep the higher).
    
3. **Long Rests** may _only_ be taken in an inn, at home, or some other secure location, as designated by the DM. They provide the same benefits as in the Rules As Written, but may come with Complications (or Boons) as described on pages 11-12 of [_Nimble_](https://nimble5e.com/).
    

## Silvered Weapons

The DMG states:

> You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for [1000 sp]. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

A quick and dirty process uses less silver and skill, but it lasts for only one hit, after which the silver is unrecoverable. Add the original cost of the ammunition or melee weapon to represent this quick-and-dirty process, plus whatever the armorer charges. Weapons made of wood, and Heavy weapons, cannot be so treated.

_Mithral_ weapons, if available, has the same effect on monsters as silver.

## Sources

Players may only use content from _Players Handbook_ (PHB), _Xanathar’s Guide to Everything_, and _Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything_, plus free content on D&D Beyond. Some games will use rules from [_Nimble_](https://nimble5e.com/) or classes from [_Masters of the Mundane_](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/353582/Masters-of-the-Mundane-A-Collection-of-Character-Classes-for-LowMagic-Settings).

I _**may**_ allow races, classes, and backgrounds from _Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft_, _Monsters of the Multiverse_, and the _Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide_ if someone asks nicely. Any other sources will require explicit permission and a copy of the text in question.

Content from the _Dungeon Master’s Guide_, _Monster Manual_, and other monster, magic item, and assorted other rules from the above sources are considered only advisory. Thus I will change them or ignore them as I see fit.

If “Unearthed Arcana” contradicts or expands on one of the sources above, or if one of my rulings is contradicted by the rules as written, players must tell me explicitly so I can evaluate and approve the change. If I do not approve a rule change explicitly, the old rule or ruling stands.

## Appendix A: Rules About Rules

New players should be advised of the following rules of ettiquette and good practice.

0. As a reminder of the classic Rule Zero: the DM is the final arbiter of what the game rules allow or disallow; their rulings supercede even the rulebooks. Or, stated another way, players may attempt anything and the DM decides whether the attempt succeeds or fails, despite books _or_dice.
    
    _Rationale:_ All roleplaying games require the Zeroth Rule, especially one with as many rules as D&D 5e. Rulings, even in defiance of The Rules, keep the game moving.
    
1. Players may argue a ruling with me, citing the rulebook, and if I have no objection to the rule I will allow it. If I _do_ object to the rule, and have given an alternate ruling, then _that’s_ the new rule going forward. (Unless I change my mind, but in general I believe in _stare decisis_.)
    
2. Rule changes and rulings which affect a character sheet take effect _between_ sessions or after the end of the current adventure, whichever makes the most sense.
    
    _Rationale:_ Just like players should check with me before assuming a rule change, _I_ will check with players and let them adapt their characters to any rule changes I make.
    
3. Rule changes and rulings which affect the _use_ of spells, class features, and racial and background abilities take effect when the DM states them. They may be appealed after the session ends.
    
    _Rationale:_ To keep the game moving I must sometimes make a ruling without consulting rule books. Sometimes these rulings will be wrong; if so I’ll admit the error and use the rules as written next time. Sometimes they will be “good enough”; if so, _that_ will be the new rule.
    
4. If players have problems with a ruling, or with the content of a session, or anything else, they should feel free to alert the DM _privately_, between sessions if the issue can wait, and the DM will try to accomodate them.
    
5. Arguing insistently with the DM during a game is bad form, and will only annoy the DM.
    
6. All the rules in this document are subject to change _with_ at least a session’s notice.
    

None of these should surprise veteran roleplayers.

---

1. Yes, this contradicts the Rules As Written. It’s a _house rule_. [↩︎](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#fnref:1)
    
2. Over Discord or another online service the DM will call on players alphabetically or any other convenient but fixed order. [↩︎](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#fnref:2)
    
3. In the real world goldsmiths’ guilds started offering this service, but in my worlds the Merchants’ Guild pretty much regulates all commerce within limits set by the local rulers. [↩︎](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#fnref:3)
    
4. In some worlds the Merchants’ Guild is a kingdom-wide or even continent-wide organization, much like late Medieval and Renaissance banks. A bank note from an affiliated guild is _almost_worth its face value, less some travel and convenience fees.
    
    In many of the same worlds, the multi-city Merchant’s Guild and the multi-city Adventurer’s Guild have an arrangement whereby an Adventurer can present their badge much like a credit card, and the merchant _may_ simply settle with the Guilds later on. Usually one must be a high-level Adventurer of good reputation, however. [↩︎](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#fnref:4)
    
5. Also, if you become a Warlock, your Patron _will_ show up. Fair warning. [↩︎](https://frank-mitchell.com/rpg/dnd5-rules/#fnref:5)
